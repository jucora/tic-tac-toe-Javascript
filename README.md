## :pencil: Description

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game. It contains the minimax algorithm so the player can compete with the computer. The minimax algorithm makes the computer smart, so every time a user selects a cell in the game, the computer will answer with the best move always, so the computer never loses. The minimax is a decision method to minimize the maximum expected loss in games with an opponent and with perfect information. The user can also play with another user. This project is part of the Microverse main curriculum.
